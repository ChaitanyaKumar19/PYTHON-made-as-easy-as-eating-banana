Python is my 3rd Programming Language which I've learnt, it was introduced to me through academics and 
I have done couple of projects on it in the context of Machine Learning.

Later the focus shifted to Java as Placement Season approached to prepare for OOPs and DSA, so I ignored python.

Now its time for me to unlearn , relearn python.

Since, I have understanding of computation process, I think this time I've upper hand in learning python.


The naive definition of a computer program can be " Take input & store - Process/work on data - show output "

So breaking down the process, we will get our content to go along. As I try to go along, I will try to update the contents in more detailed way.

1. Taking input & store

   points of importance
   
   - input methods
   - all data types to store 
   - support from python to work with those data types (inbuild methods)
 
 2. Process/work on data
 
    points of importance
    
    - loops
    - imp keywords
    - user defined methods
    - in built modules
    - OOPs in python
    
3. show output
   
    points of importance
    
    - various ways of outputing data
    - transferring data to a file
